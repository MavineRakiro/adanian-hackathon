#FACIAL RECOGNITION DESIGN FLOW.
#Using computer vision(cv2) this program aims to detect faces with the aim to store them using the barest storage space.
#This will be used to log in in to "Developer's cult"
#Haar cascade is used for face detection(find attached the file in this repository.)

#DESIGN FLOW.
# 1. Launch camera(spoiler alert ikik) and run a while loop till a face is found.
# 2. Convert color to grey for better results.
# 3. Convert and scale. Draw a rectangle around the face to ensure detection has taken place. 
# 4. After facial recognition and data converion for storage, release the captured image and turn off camera. 
# .......
# The image is divided into pixels and then encodded into a numpy array. (Image is converted from numpy array to the equivalent image too.)
# The stored(registered) image is then compared with the newly captured image using the numpy arrays
